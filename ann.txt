pseudocode for ann classification:-
1. Initialize the weights and biases of the network randomly.
2. Set the learning rate and maximum number of epochs.
3. For each epoch:
   a. Shuffle the training set.
   b. For each input x in the training set:
      i. Feed the input forward through the network to obtain the output y_hat.
      ii. Compute the error between the predicted output and the actual output.
      iii. Backpropagate the error through the network to update the weights and biases.
   c. Calculate the accuracy of the network on the validation set.
   d. If the accuracy is above a threshold, stop training and return the network.
4. Return the trained network.

To use the trained ANN for classification, you would use the following steps:

1. Given a new input x, feed it forward through the trained network to obtain the output y_hat.
2. Interpret the output as a probability distribution over the possible classes.
3. Assign the input to the class with the highest probability (i.e., the argmax of the output).

Note that the specific details of the ANN architecture, activation functions, 
loss function, and optimization algorithm may vary depending on the problem and data at hand. 
The above pseudocode provides a general framework for training an ANN for classification,
 but it may need to be adapted to suit the specific requirements of the task.
